# Cybersecurity-Projects

Welcome to my collection of cybersecurity projects. This repository showcases a variety of offensive and defensive security techniques, tools, and methodologies that Iâ€™ve worked on. The goal of these projects is to strengthen my skills in penetration testing, threat hunting, incident response, and vulnerability management.

Projects
1. Network Penetration Testing
Description: This project involves conducting penetration testing on a simulated network. It includes network reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation of vulnerable systems, and post-exploitation activities.
Tools: Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark
Key Skills: Exploiting misconfigurations, using Metasploit modules, analyzing traffic using Wireshark.

2. Vulnerability Assessment and Mitigation
Description: I conducted a full vulnerability assessment on a company's network infrastructure. The project includes scanning for vulnerabilities, analyzing results, and providing mitigation steps to reduce the risk.
Tools: Nessus, OpenVAS, QualysGuard
Key Skills: Vulnerability scanning, risk assessment, remediation strategies.

3. Threat Hunting & Incident Response
Description: This project demonstrates proactive threat hunting techniques and how to respond to security incidents. It includes log analysis, identifying potential threats, and simulating an incident response process.
Tools: Splunk, ELK Stack
Key Skills: Log analysis, threat detection, SIEM configuration, incident response.

4. Malware Analysis
Description: I performed static and dynamic analysis of a suspicious file to uncover its behavior. The project involves reversing the malware and understanding its impact on a simulated environment.
Tools: Ghidra, Wireshark, Sandbox analysis tools
Key Skills: Malware reverse engineering, network traffic analysis, static and dynamic analysis.
